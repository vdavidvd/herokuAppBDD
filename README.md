Hi there!

This is Cucumber BDD Project in Java.
This project is testing the http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/ application and its functionalities.

I selected couple of functionalities for testing and they are:
- Context Menu
- Disappearing Elements
- Drag and Drop
- Dropdown List
- Dynamically Loaded Page Elements
- Form Autentication
- Horizontal Slider
- Hovers
- Key Presses

To start this project you need to have Java version 11 or higher, Maven installed in your machine and some Java Editior if you want to start there or 
if you want to start this project in command prompt then you need to position yourself in the project directory where pom.xml is presented and open there
command promp and run command mvn test. After that project will start and when all tests are finished you will get Cucumber HTML report opened in your 
default browser.

This is screenshot of the report:
